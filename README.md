Command-Line Argument Parsing:

The script starts by parsing command-line arguments, presumably for database connection details (e.g., database name, server name, etc.). If the parsing fails, default values are provided.
Error Logging Function:

There's a function named errorLog that takes an SQL Alchemy engine, an audit key, an exception (e), and an optional detail. This function logs errors to a database table named log.Error.
ODBC Driver and SQL Alchemy Engine Setup:

The script determines the available ODBC driver for SQL Server and sets up an SQL Alchemy engine for connecting to the Microsoft SQL Server database.
Importing Necessary Libraries:

Various libraries are imported, including datetime, pandas, azure.identity, json, requests, sqlalchemy, numpy, urllib, base64, jira, and BeautifulSoup.
Facebook API Data Retrieval:

The script uses the Facebook Graph API to retrieve data from a specified Facebook page.
It fetches posts including details such as message content, creation time, share count, comment count, and reaction count (likes). This data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame (df).
Video data is also retrieved, including video ID, title, description, creation time, source, thumbnail, and views. This data is stored in another Pandas DataFrame (video_df).
The script then merges the post and video DataFrames based on the message/description column.
Data Transformation and Cleanup:

The merged DataFrame (merged_df) is processed to handle missing values and standardize column names.
The "status_type" column is transformed to represent media types as either "IMAGE" or "VIDEO".
Database Insertion:

The final merged DataFrame is inserted into a specified SQL Server table using the to_sql method.
Printing Success Message:

If the script executes successfully, it prints a success message: "code uploaded successfully."
